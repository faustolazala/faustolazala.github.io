        <title>Retrocausality, can the effect come before the cause?</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://faustolazala.github.io/p/retrocausality/causeeffect.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Retrocausality, can the effect come before the cause?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally we, as individuals, are coded to understand that everything happens for a reason. We experience time flowing in the forward direction, it&amp;rsquo;s how things work. One could argue there&amp;rsquo;s certain iterations of retrocausality in some type of precognitions if not all, but can it really happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Retrocausality&lt;/a&gt; is a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, nothing we know can break causality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;maybe-were-moving-too-slow&#34;&gt;Maybe we&amp;rsquo;re moving too slow&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, if you could move faster than light, you could arrive at your destination before leaving. Does that mean you&amp;rsquo;ll be at two places at one? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an observer it will appear as if you are in both places at the same time, but in reality the observer will see you at your departure point until the light of you leaving reaches him. In other words, you can only be at one place at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;it-doesnt-matter&#34;&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause and effect only has a meaning on the bigger scale of things, we humans, are part of a bigger system controlled by time, so naturally, for us, that&amp;rsquo;s the only way things work.&lt;/p&gt;
