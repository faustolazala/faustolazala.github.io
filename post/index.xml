      <description>The most important choice you get to have is picking your life companion, and yet thereâ€™s not enough information on how to be good at it.
Society and our biological clock pushes us to rush this decision when we should be thinking it through, the same way we spend a whole year in high school trying to decide on the perfect career path to follow, and just then, we take roughly 4 years studying how to be good at it.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: No.
Naturally we, as individuals, are coded to understand that everything happens for a reason. We experience time flowing in the forward direction, it&amp;rsquo;s how things work. One could argue there&amp;rsquo;s certain iterations of retrocausality in some type of precognitions if not all, but can it really happen?
Retrocausality is a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.</description>
