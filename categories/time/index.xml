      <description>TL;DR: No.
Naturally we, as individuals, are coded to understand that everything happens for a reason. We experience time flowing in the forward direction, it&amp;rsquo;s how things work. One could argue there&amp;rsquo;s certain iterations of retrocausality in some type of precognitions if not all, but can it really happen?
Retrocausality is a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.</description>
